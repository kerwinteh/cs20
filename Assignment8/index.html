    <h3>API Results</h3>
    <p>This is CoinCap API. It gives real-time pricing and market activity for over 1000 cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>API website: https://docs.coincap.io/</p>
    <p>There are several options for this API. The one I used was the asset option where I can see a list
    of asset data they have. From there, I filtered the assets by id and used that to find bitcoin data such as
    its name, symbol and current real time price.</p>
    <p>2 options where this could be useful is when trying to create a cryptocurrency trading app and
    when someone just simply wants to keep track of the bitcoin prices without having to go into an app everyday.
    For example, by using this API, I can just open this website and check live bitcoin prices everyday!</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <p>The most challenging part about this assignment was figuring out how to access the element I wanted to
    in the json object using javascript. The most satisfying part of this assignment was after I completed it and
    refreshed, I saw the bitcoin prices actually changing according to real time and I didn't know it did that
    prior to doing this assignment.</p>
